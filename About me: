- heyo, I'm commonly known as "dark" due to my online profile but any name is okay
- don't really have many interests but they are gaming (ofc) music and having a laugh
- I'm not a coder at all. I would like to know how to code and get to know the bacics
- if you need to reach out to me, you can use discord "Soap Trusted You#0909" COD reference ðŸ¤£

- friends who can have a laugh and teach me tome coding tips
- people who are willing to help eachother with problems
- anything really ðŸ˜…

What consoles/gaming devices do you commonly use?
- I use oculus quest 2 (no pc tho)

If you have any questions feel free to ask on my discord or anywhere you can.


PS. Thanks for taking your time to read this (I'm verry now to any coding so don't expect me to know anything)
